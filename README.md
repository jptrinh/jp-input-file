# File Upload

A WeWeb custom file upload component with drag & drop, validation, and customizable dropzone via `wwLayout`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run serve --port=8080
```

Then add `localhost:8080` as a custom element in the WeWeb editor developer popup.

## Build

```bash
npm run build --name="ww-input-file" --type="element"
```

## Features

### Customizable Dropzone

The upload area uses a `wwLayout` dropzone, so you can drag and drop any WeWeb elements (text, icons, images, buttons) inside it to fully customize the look and feel.

### Single & Multi File Modes

- **Single** - replaces the current file on each upload
- **Multi** - accumulates files up to a configurable max count

### Validation

Built-in validation for file size (min/max), total size, file count, and file type. Accepted types include image, video, audio, PDF, CSV, Excel, Word, JSON, or custom extensions.

### Data Encoding

Optionally expose uploaded files as **Base64** or **Binary** data via toggle settings.
